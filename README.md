# Good Morning Website

## Project Overview

The Good Morning Website is a web application that generates and displays a new good morning image and quote daily. This project aims to provide users with a fresh and positive start to their day through visually appealing images and inspiring quotes.
Original intent was for family members to use, so there is a mix of English and Spanish images in the library!
